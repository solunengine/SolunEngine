# Solun Engine -  2D and 3D Game Engine

---

**Solun Engine** is a new-era, open-source game engine forged on a radical principle: delivering uncompromising performance within a universally accessible environment. We are building a powerful tool for creators, free from constraints.

## Our Core Philosophy
**Performance, freedom, and developer experience are in our DNA.**

We believe that high-performance game development should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to build the ultimate, community-driven engine that empowers creators with the tools they need to bring their visions to life.

## How It Works

We leverage a high-speed **JavaScript/Node.js** core via **Electron** to interface directly with the **WebGPU API**, unlocking raw, next-generation graphical power. This unique architecture combines the simplicity of web technologies with the low-level performance of modern graphics APIs.

## Key Features

* **WebGPU API Integration:** Access raw, high-performance graphics directly from the web.
* **JavaScript/Node.js Core:** A familiar and powerful foundation.
* **Lua Scripting:** Empower creators with the simplicity and speed of Lua.
* **Upcoming Lunex Language:** Paving the way for our custom-built language designed specifically for game and UI development.
* **Open-Source & MIT Licensed:** Solun Engine is governed by the MIT license, ensuring it remains free and open for everyone.
